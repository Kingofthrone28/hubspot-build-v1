          <p><span>There's a ton of buzz about Health Coaches out there right now, which is probably why you're here!</span><br><span></span></p>
          <p><span>A Health Coach is a wellness professional whose main role is to guide clients to reach their health and wellness goals, whether that’s sleeping better, boosting energy, weight loss, stress management, and so much more. Health Coaches create a safe space for their clients to explore their health, facilitating behavior and lifestyle change that can be sustained for the long-term.</span><br><span></span></p>
          <p><span>Using their nutrition, holistic health and coaching education, Health Coaches help their clients discover which foods and lifestyle choices make them feel best. Most importantly, Health Coaches take a holistic approach to health, focusing not just on food, but also all the other areas of life that can support and nourish overall health, such as career, spirituality, relationships, and environment. This is an IIN core concept that we call “primary foods,” and IIN Health Coaches utilize this concept in their work to set themselves apart from other Health Coaches.</span></p>

          <p><span>Discovering your best self and taking those learnings to inspire and empower others is the heart and soul of what we do.
