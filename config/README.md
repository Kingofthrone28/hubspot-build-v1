# Config Folder

## Usage

The base `./config/site-footer.html` and `./config/site-header.html` go in the global hubspot advanced settings for the [default](https://app.hubspot.com/settings/23273748/website/pages/all-domains/page-templates) domain settings. The `./config/integrativenutrition/site-header.html` and `./config/integrativenutrition/site-footer.html` go into the `www.integrativenutrition.com` domain settings.

## Google Fonts

Where possible, improve page performance and speed by combining external http requests to reduce your overall number of calls -- here, you can use a single call to the gFonts api to get all the fonts you need. For more info, see the google fonts [Getting Started doc](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started).
